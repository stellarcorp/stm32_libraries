@par Example Description

How to use the HASH peripheral to hash data using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms 
when data are fed to the HASH unit with DMA.

For this example, DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the HASH processor.
The SHA-1 message digest result is a 160-bit long data, and the MD5 message digest
result is a 128-bit long data.

The expected HASH digests (for SHA1 and MD5) are already computed using an online
HASH tool. Those values are compared to those computed by the HASH peripheral.

In case there is a mismatch the blue LED (LED2) is turned ON.
In case the SHA1 digest is computed correctly the green LED (LED1) is turned ON.
In case the MD5 digest is computed correctly the green LED (LED1) is turned ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment

    - This example runs on STM32L4P5xx devices.
  
    - This example has been tested with a STM32L4P5xx embedded on an 
    32L4P5GDISCOVERY board and can be easily tailored to any other supported 
    device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
